# Data Vizualisation Project: 2015 US Flight

## Context: Which airline should you fly on to avoid significant delays?

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.

To see the visualization, go to this [page](https://clementpavue.github.io/DataVizProject/) and wait at least 10 sec. before browsing.

For this project, jQuery is use to manipulate the DOM for the website navigation and D3.js for the
data visualization.
